# Blog-Shop-Chatroom
 The blog is based on texts from tourist destinations, which are partially displayed in a pop-up window on an interactive world map, and in "more detail" goes to a page with a complete text and a short videos and images. It would be possible for readers to leave comments there, but the condition for that is that they are registered, and that segment has the validation and token allocation for leaving comments.
The idea is for the blog to be self-sustaining, so users can buy some souvenir as t-shirts, caps and mugs with the blog's logo. The products is loaded from JSON. Shopping is also only for registered users. In the store, there would be the ability to filter by product colors or sizes.
Registered users would have the option of using the chatroom, where they would exchange impressions and experiences from the trip.
Linked FB/Insta icons and contact form is at the end.
